\chapter{Related work}

The work related to this dissertation spans four fields: time series data, digital signal processing, high-dimensional data, and machine learning.
While there exists considerable overlap between the topics in these fields upon which this dissertation touches, we find the terminology does not always align.
To be able to draw the necessary parallels, we do not structure this chapter through the four aforementioned fields, but through the issues we encounter further in this dissertation.
These are dimensionality reduction
