  abstract        = { Large datasets are increasingly common and are often
                  difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is
                  a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets,
                  increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing
                  information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated
                  variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such
                  new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an
                  eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are
                  defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA
                  an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another
                  sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed
                  that are tailored to various different data types and
                  structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic
                  ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will
                  then describe some variants of PCA and their application. }

abstract = {The use of automated subset search algorithms is reviewed and issues concerning model selection and selection criteria are discussed. In addition, a Monte Carlo study is reported which presents data regarding the frequency with which authentic and noise variables are selected by automated subset algorithms. In particular, the effects of the correlation between predictor variables, the number of candidate predictor variables, the size of the sample, and the level of significance for entry and deletion of variables were studied for three automated subset algorithms: BACKWARD ELIMINATION, FORWARD SELECTION, and STEPWISE. Results indicated that: (1) the degree of correlation between the predictor variables affected the frequency with which authentic predictor variables found their way into the final model; (2) the number of candidate predictor variables affected the number of noise variables that gained entry to the model; (3) the size of the sample was of little practical importance in determining the number of authentic variables contained in the final model; and (4) the population multiple coefficient of determination could be faithfully estimated by adopting a statistic that is adjusted by the total number of candidate predictor variables rather than the number of variables in the final model.},
