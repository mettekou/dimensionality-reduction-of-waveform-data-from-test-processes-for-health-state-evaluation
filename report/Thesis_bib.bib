  abstract        = "Recently, many companies and research organizations are
                  seeking scalable solutions by using Hadoop ecosystems. The log
                  data management with large-scale and real-time properties is
                  one of the appropriate application on top of Hadoop. In this
                  paper, we focus on SQL and NoSQL choices for building
                  Hadoop-based log data management system. For this purpose, we
                  first select major products supporting SQL and NoSQL, and we
                  then present an appropriate scheme for each product by
                  considering its own characteristics. All the schema are for
                  real-time monitoring and analyzing the log data. For each
                  product, we implement insertion and selection operations of
                  log data in Hadoop, and we analyze the performance of these
                  operation. Analysis results show that MariaDB and MongoDB are
                  fast in the insertion, and PostgreSQL and HBase are fast in
                  the selection. We believe that our evaluation results will be
                  very helpful for users to choose Hadoop SQL and NoSQL products
                  for handling large-scale and real-time log data.",

  abstract        = { Large datasets are increasingly common and are often
                  difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is
                  a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets,
                  increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing
                  information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated
                  variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such
                  new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an
                  eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are
                  defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA
                  an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another
                  sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed
                  that are tailored to various different data types and
                  structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic
                  ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will
                  then describe some variants of PCA and their application. }
