\chapter{Abstract}

An automotive supplier company develops, builds, and tests proportional valves for use in its products. As part of the tests
of these valves, it records sensor waveforms and extracts scalar variables from these by numerical algorithms to determine
the health state of the valves through limit checks on the scalar variables. This health state is currently binary: a valve either
passes or fails a test. In this masterâ€™s dissertation, we propose to replace the extraction of scalar variables from sensor
waveforms by a statistical model which takes the sensor waveforms as inputs.
We bring data organization and statistical modelling techniques to an
automotive supplier company which only stores data on file servers and performs no statistical analysis. While doing so,
we compare well established to state-of-the-art model building for logistic regression. Our focus for the state of the
art is on dimensionality reduction before performing the logistic regression and an integrated approach to dimensionality
reduction and classification.
The two approaches we choose for dimensionality reduction are transforming the output of the matrix profile algorithm and learning shapelets.
