# Master's Dissertation

This repository contains the source code for my master's dissertation for the Master of Science in Statistical Data Analysis at Ghent University, during the 2021-2022 academic year.

## Structure

- The `poster` directory contains the LaTeX source code for the poster presented at the poster pre-defense on the MaStat day (22 March 2022)
- The `report` directory contains the LaTeX source code for the master's disseration report to be handed in at the end of the master's dissertation
- The `src` directory contains the Python source code for the data analysis during the master's dissertation

## Feedback

- The work is of a decent scientific level and contains no statistical errors
- The report is well-structured and enjoyable to read, but lacks data visualizations
- Most of the work stems from effort near the deadline and not during the academic year
- Matrix profile regression and shapelet learning have more potential than the work demonstrates
